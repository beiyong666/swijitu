EdgeOne FINAL debug package with ping endpoints
--------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
- This package includes explicit /api/ping endpoints (both under functions/api and functions root)
  so you can verify whether your Pages Functions are actually receiving /api/* requests
  (if /api/ping returns JSON, functions work; if it returns XML, the request is hitting object storage).

Files to deploy:
- Upload entire 'functions' directory to your Pages Functions area.
- Place all files from 'public' into your site's static root (index.html, admin.html, app.js, style.css).

KV:
- Bind your KV namespace as variable name 'wj' (env.wj).

Important debug steps (do these first):
1) Test ping (should return JSON):
   curl -i -X GET https://your-domain/api/ping
   Expected response body: { "ok": true, "pong": true, "envHasWj": true/false }
   - If you see XML (<?xml ...>), your /api/* requests are not reaching Functions. Check deployment path.
2) Test create dir (POST):
   curl -i -X POST https://your-domain/api/upload -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"dir":"testdir","url":""}'
   - If this returns JSON ok:true, creation succeeded.
   - If you get XML MethodNotAllowed, requests are again going to object storage.

Common causes of MethodNotAllowed XML (and fixes):
- You uploaded API files to the wrong place (they must be in the Functions area, not the static assets).
- Your platform routes /api/* to static storage unless functions exist at functions/api/*.js â€” ensure functions/api/upload.js exists on the deployed service.
- You are using a CDN/storage domain instead of your site domain (double-check the URL and it's the Pages site domain).

If after deploying this package you still get XML for /api/ping, paste the full Response body here and tell me exactly which files you uploaded where (functions vs static). I will analyze and give direct instructions.
